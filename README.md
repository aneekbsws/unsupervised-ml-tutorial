# unsupervised-ml-tutorial
A compilation of codes built as a part of the tutorial on unsupervised machine learning.

# Part 1 - K-Means
In this part, at first a dummy dataset is taken and the K-Means algorithm is built from scratch and applied on that dataset to understand the basic workflow of how K-Means works.
Later on, it was used to compress images - where each pixel was treated as a datapoint and were grouped into 16 clusters representing 16 clusters. Reducing the number of colours helps greatly in reducing the size of the image.
